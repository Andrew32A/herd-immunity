What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Initial population size: 1000
Vaccinated percentage: 20%
Name of the virus: Sniffles
Mortality rate: 0.3
Reproductive rate of Sniffles was: 0.4
Total initial infected: 10

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
About 4% of the population died from the virus.

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
About 80% of the population became infected at some point before the virus burnt out.

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
The total times a vaccine saved a sick individual was: 39676

Total steps: 7
Total interactions: 80000 
Total people dead: 237
Total vaccinated: 563
Total infections: 800
